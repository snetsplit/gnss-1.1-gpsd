This project adds a way to get GPS on Waydroid from a host's GPSD server. It exists because I had a lot of trouble getting GPS to work reliably on Waydroid using existing techniques. It works good for my use case. Hopefully if yours is different it'll be a good starting point to make your own.


Install:
This needs to be compiled into a Waydroid image. To do this, see: [Build.md](Build.md)


The host needs to be configured to share with Waydroid. To do this, see [EndUser.md](EndUser.md)
